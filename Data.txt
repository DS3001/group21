Data
  Using Python as the tool for this exploration, the dataset was sourced from a CSV file titled gss.csv. The first step in the analysis involved importing essential libraries, namely NumPy and pandas. These libraries offer the capabilities needed for data manipulation and analysis.
    The initial observation revealed the dataset to be extensive, with 72,390 rows and 6,645 columns. Given the scope of the study, which intended to focus on the years 2018, 2021, and 2022, a subset of the data was isolated. Surprisingly, the data for 2019 and 2020 was missing. The analysis then honed in on the crucial variables, comprising three subject variables (age, sex, and marital status) and a target variable, fluvax, which indicates whether an individual has been vaccinated against the flu.
  One of the pivotal steps in data analysis is data cleaning. Here, the integrity and quality of the data were paramount. Notably, rows containing missing values in the 'fluvax' and 'age' columns were removed. The rationale behind this was clear: an analysis revolving around vaccination rates would be skewed without these crucial data points. This decision underscores the significance of having complete and accurate data for drawing meaningful conclusions.
  Upon further analysis, a significant challenge arose. The initial plan was to conduct an in-depth analysis spanning the three years: 2018, 2021, and 2022. Yet, it soon became apparent that after filtering out incomplete entries, only data from 2022 remained usable. This realization dramatically altered the trajectory of the study. What began as a multi-year analysis was narrowed down to focus solely on the most recent year, 2022.
