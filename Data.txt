Data
  The study utilized a dataset from the CSV file named gss.csv, which is expansive in its scope with 72,390 rows and a staggering 6,645 columns. For the specific objectives of the study, the focus was narrowed down to a subset of data from the years 2018, 2021, and 2022 with the aim to investigate the flu vaccine status based on pivotal variables: age, sex, and marital status. Age is a quantitative measure, while sex offers categorical values like 'male' and 'female'. Marital status is another categorical variable encompassing values such as 'divorced', 'never married', 'widowed', and 'married'. The crux of the study revolves around the 'fluvax' variable, which indicates whether an individual received the flu vaccine, marked by values 'yes' or 'no'.
  While reading the dataset, given its vast size, it was essential to set the low_memory flag to False to ensure efficient data processing. In the pursuit to refine the data for the study, challenges surfaced. Although the intention was to analyze data from 2018, 2021, and 2022, it became evident that data from the years 2019 and 2020 was absent. Moreover, from the extensive list of available columns, only a select few were deemed pertinent to the study's objectives. As the data cleaning progressed, it was observed that there were missing values in the crucial columns of 'fluvax' and 'age'. To maintain the integrity of the analysis, these rows were dropped, which, while ensuring accuracy, reduced the overall sample size.
  Visualizations created using histograms and count plots further revealed a crucial insight: post data cleaning, the only usable data was from the year 2022. This meant that the intended three-year span for analysis was no longer viable due to missing data from 2018 and 2021. Thus, the focus of the study pivoted to exclusively concentrate on the 2022 data. This evolution in the study's direction exemplifies the paramount importance of data preparation and a deep understanding of its intricacies in research. While the initial plan was expansive, the reality of data availability reshaped the trajectory.
