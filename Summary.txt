This study examines the influences of demographic indicators, notably age, gender, and marital status, on flu vaccination rates, by analyzing a dataset from the General Social Survey (GSS). Initially, data from the years 2018, 2021, and 2022 are filtered out of the larger dataset, which includes various variables from different years. The primary focus is on the 'age', 'sex', 'marital', and 'fluvax' columns, which indicate a person's age, gender, marital status, and whether they received the flu vaccine, respectively. After cleaning the dataset of missing values, histograms and count plots are generated to visually assess the relationship between vaccine uptake and age. Moreover, count plots are also created to depict the relationship of vaccine uptake with gender and marital status. The same visualizations are repeated for the year 2022 alone, allowing for a more specific temporal insight. Using histograms for visualization facilitated an immediate comparison of vaccination statuses among various groups. One standout finding was the pivotal role age played: older individuals, especially those over 60, were significantly more inclined to get vaccinated, suggesting a pronounced awareness of their susceptibility to the flu. In contrast, gender didn't seem to have any discernible effect on vaccination decisions, as both genders mirrored similar patterns. Marital status, on the other hand, unfolded a more intricate picture. Individuals who'd never married potentially exhibited higher vaccination rates, which might be attributed to their higher social exposure, hinting at a relationship between social activity and health precautions. However, the research encountered certain limitations. The most noticeable was the absence of a broader temporal dataset, especially from years preceding the global COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic undoubtedly influenced public perceptions about vaccinations, rendering the singular year data from 2022 less comprehensive in gauging long-term trends or attitudes. While the current study carves out an essential understanding, the scope for further exploration remains vast. Investigating other potential determinants, like educational background, economic status, regional influences, or even political inclinations, could be monumental. This becomes especially pertinent in a post-pandemic world where health decisions and public perceptions are in constant change, necessitating robust research endeavors.
